    "In this jupyter notebook, you will find the guidelines and questions to be completed for the assignment for the computational modeling course. The assignment is due by **14th March 2024 at 13:00 GMT**, and must be submitted via Turnitin on KEATS. This means that you must download this completed jupyter notebook from CoCalc, save it locally, and then submit it via KEATS. You can download your completed jupyter notebook from CoCalc once completed via the `Files` tab, and then clicking on the 'cloud' download button on the right hand side. Remember that submitting at the last moment might put you at risk of unexpected events \\(failing internet connection or other problems\\), so plan your time, and aim to submit well BEFORE the deadline. A section on KEATS will be opened soon to allow for your online submissions there. Please note that the completed jupyter notebooks should be submitted directly \\(this file ending .ipynb\\), rather than a pdf or text document, so that the code can be run by the markers and checked for accuracy of the code. Submitted work will be checked for similarity of the submitted notebooks to other students or AI assisstance \\- plagiarism will not be tolerated. Note that the basic similarity measure on TurnItIn will be high, due to the same questions in each notebook, and will just be used as a guide, so don't worry if this crude measure is high. \n",
    "\n",
    "This document will provide a set of three problems that you will need to solve by using the knowledge built up from the notebooks and exercises completed during the course. You can revisit previous notebooks to refresh your knowledge from the course. The various parts of the problems should be submitted in separate code cells under each subsection of the questions. These cells should generate the results, and will build on the work of previous cells. Furthermore, text cells should be included with discussion and more information about each question where required. Note that the code itself \\(Python cells\\) will be marked, so please follow good coding practices outlined in the lectures \\(appropriate comments in the code, and clean, consistent and well structured code, with output appropriately formatted for readability\\). Note that all cells should execute properly without error messages given, such that when you go in the menu to `'Kernel'` then `'Restart & Run All'`, all the appropriate output from the code cells will be generated for marking each of the questions. **Finally, please fill out your name, k\\-number and email address below**, as this is how your marks will be returned to you. Good Luck!\n"

    "## Problem 1: Molecular conformers\n",
    "\n",
    "A molecular conformer is a particular shape or atomic arrangement that a molecule can adopt. Often molecules will flip between these two arrangements of their atoms. The aim in this problem is to model the changes in the numbers of molecules in different shapes (conformers) over a period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that there are two conformers of a particular molecule which we want to model, conformer $A$ and conformer $B$, and the total number of molecules is fixed, so that $n_A + n_B$ remains the same. We assume that every hour, 20% of the current population of conformer $A$ will turn into conformer $B$. However, there is a chance of also transitioning in the other direction, and so each hour, 10% of the molecules in conformer $B$ turn back into conformer $A$. We assume that initially, there are 150 '$A$ molecules' and 150 '$B$ molecules'. We also assume that the changes in populations take place in discrete time intervals on the hour, each hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) We can write the number of $A$-molecules ($n_A$) and $B$-molecules ($n_B$) as a vector each hour, $$ \\begin{bmatrix} n_A \\\\ n_B \\end{bmatrix}.$$ Furthermore, we can recast the problem of finding the vector from one hour to the next, as a single matrix equation, with a linear system of equations. By acting the initial vector of populations on a $2 \\times 2$ matrix of fixed probabilities, indicating the proportion of molecules which transition between states or remain in the current state, you should be able to find the vector of populations in the second hour to be $n_A=135$ and $n_B=165$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a code cell below, to initialize a numpy array of the appropriate $2 \\times 2$ matrix of probabilities assigned to the variable `P`, and the vector of current $A$ and $B$ populations, assigned to the variable `pop`, which should be initialized to $(150, 150)$. Calculate the matrix multiplication of `P` and the vector `pop` (use the `numpy` module to help), and therefore print out what the population of each type is after one hour (which should be $n_A = 135$ and $n_B=165$). Finally, have the code test whether the matrix `P` is a symmetric matrix or not, and print out a statement about this.** [8 marks]"

    "b) We are particularly interested in what happens after a long time - are there a steady number of $A$- vs. $B$-molecules, or does one conformer win out? If it is a 'steady state' (when the populations settle down to a constant over time), then what are these steady populations? Note that the transition probabilities remain the same each hour, so we can use the same probability matrix, `P`, and use it to update the populations many times. \n",

Each iteration, also check that the total number of molecules ($n_A + n_B$) is conserved, and equal to the original number (300, to within reasonable numerical precision).

    "c) This long-time 'steady-state' behaviour can calculated directly, since we know that any vector where the application of a matrix results only in only a scaling of this vector (leaving the relative magnitudes of the elements of the vector unchanged) must be an eigenvector of the matrix. Specifically, if the populations are steady and not growing overall, the eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector must also be equal to 1. (Check the definition of an eigenvector to make sure you are happy with this logic). \n",

Find and print out the factor that the eigenvector should be multiplied by, in order to ensure that the long-time steady state populations of $A$- and $B$-molecules matches the values obtained in part c). This number should be printed out to 4 decimal places.**\n",

    "## Problem 2: The logistic map\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we are considering the logistic map, a very simple sequence with very non-trivial behaviour. It simply updates a (scalar) variable, such that its next value depends solely on its current value. The sequence has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{n+1} = a \\times x_n \\times (1-x_n)$ ,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_n$ is the current variable in the range $[0,1]$, $x_{n+1}$ is the next value in the sequence, and $a$ is the growth rate which we will consider to be in the range $[0,4]$. This is often used to model systems which grow under a constraint of a finite number of resources, where e.g. $x_n$ represents the fraction of the total possible population size at a particular time. Here, the population will grow according to $x_n$, but be constrained by the $(1-x_n)$ term when $x_n$ gets too large. When $x_n=0$, the population is zero, and when $x_n=1$, the population is at its maximum possible size.  Indeed, since the resources are limited, the expansion is also proportional to $(1-x_n)$ and if the civilization reaches the maximum population of $x=1$ it will have exhausted all its resources and then collapses to $x=0$. Note that compared to the problem above, this sequence has non-linear (quadratic) terms in $x_n$, which has a profound affect, especially in the long-time limiting behaviour. As a background to this problem, it may be helpful to watch the following video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&list=WL&index=74&t=0s).\n",
    "\n",
    "a) **Write a function called `find_fix_point` in the code cell below, which takes as its arguments, the growth rate $a$, and an initial value for $x_0$. It should return the convergence point of the sequence. We assume in this problem that the sequence reaches a converged state after $n=100$ iterations, so that the convergence point $x^*$ can be approximated by the $n=100$ element of the sequence ($x_{100}$).** [6 marks]"

    "## Problem 3: Projectile motion\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the big challenges in mathematical physics is the solution to differential equations, such as Newtons equations. In this problem, we aim to simulate the motion of a projectile under the force of gravity. While simple 'free' projectiles like this can be solved analytically (with the 'constant acceleration' equations), we are going to instead use the Euler method to numerically integrate these equations in time to follow the trajectory of the projectile, and so these analytic constant acceleration equations should *not* be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we note that we can decouple the $x$ (horizontal) and $y$ (vertical) motion. We therefore aim to end up with two arrays for the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates for each time step that we consider (as well as another set of arrays for the components of the velocity). Finally, to solve differential equations, we will need to specify an initial condition, i.e. the initial $x$ and $y$ position for the projectile, as well as the initial velocity in each direction. Considering the propagation in the $y$-direction (the $x$ direction is simple, as there is no acceleration and the velocity is therefore constant), we can write the expression for the propagation of the coupled $y$-position and $y$-velocity of the particle as\n",

Calculate the number of timesteps required simulate this maximum time, and initialize numpy arrays to hold the $x$- and $y$- positions and velocities for each time step. It will also be worth initializing variables to store the initial speed, height and angle of the trajectory rather than hard coding them, so that these can be simply changed later on.**\n",
